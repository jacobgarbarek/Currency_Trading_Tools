The purpose of this project is to develop useful graphing tools for currency trading. There are three tools that I created in the project. This includes a best conversion finder
which takes in a data set of exchange rates and allows the user to find the best conversion rate between their two specified currencies. This tool was implemented by making use
of Bellman-Ford's graphing algorithm. An arbitrage finder tool was also implemented by allowing users to accurately identify and price differentials within a provided data
set of exchange rates. This tool was implemented using Floyd-Warshall's graphing algorithm. Additionally, a bridge exchange finder tool was implemented for users to locate any
exchanges (bridges) which if were made unavailable would mean some currencies within the provided dataset would no longer be able to be traded with.

I plan on further developing this project by incorporating an API that can be used to continously obtain updated exchange rates.
